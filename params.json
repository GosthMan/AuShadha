","body":"![AuShadha](http://dreaswar.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/aushadha_logo_1281.png)\r\n\r\nAuShadha  (औषध)\r\n========\r\n\r\nAuShadha (औषध): Means medicine in Sanskrit. \r\n\r\nThis is a Open Source Electornic Medical Records (EMR) & Public Health Management System for Small Clinics.\r\n\r\nIt might be even suited for speciality medical practice after some customisation. \r\n\r\nIt is developed with Python, Django and Dojo \r\n\r\nFor Development the code uses sqlite3 database, but with Django DB backend we can extend this to any database ( PostgresSQL is preferred ).\r\n\r\nAuShadha code is licensed under GNU-GPL Version 3. Django, Dojo, Icons and other thrid party modules are licensed as per their authors. This should be honoured.\r\n\r\n\r\nAims\r\n====\r\n\r\nThere are many great Open Source EMR and Clinic Management projects, but most of them have very poor front ends. \r\n\r\nAs in life, beauty and usability are key in medical practice.\r\n\r\nIt is natural that more visually appealing it is more you want to use it. \r\n\r\nAuShadha will strive to achieve a balance between back and front end design. \r\n\r\nTo achieve that aim Django and Dojo has been chosen. \r\n\r\nAuShadha is designed by me, a Medical Doctor in association with other Developers, so usability and practicability will always be foremost. \r\n\r\nAuShadha benefits from inputs, feature requests from my medical colleagues as the development progresses. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to Test\r\n===========\r\n\r\n1) AuShadha requirements please refer to Requirements.txt in docs/\r\n\r\n2) AuShadha has been tested and developed with Python 2.7, Django 1.4.1 and Dojo 1.7.2 in Linux. It should work as long as dependencies are satisfied. \r\n\r\n3) Ideally create a Python Virtual Environment. If virtualenv is not installed, please run in Debian systems <code> sudo easy_install virtualenv </code>\r\n\r\n4) After installing virtualenv, Create a Python Virtual Environment  <code> virtualenv python_env </code> \r\n\r\n5) Change the working directory to the virtualenv folder <code> cd python_env </code> and activate it <code> source bin/activate </code>\r\n\r\n6) With Python pip installed, run <code> pip install -f requirements.txt </code>. This will install all the necessary dependencies you need. \r\n \r\n7) cd into src/AuShadha directory <code> cd src/AuShadha </code>\r\n\r\n8) run <code> python manage.py runserver </code>\r\n\r\n9) Use your browser to navigate to http://localhost:8000/AuShadha/. You will be greeted with a login page. Use username = admin, password = admin for a trial run. \r\n\r\n10) Please read the issues, license before using. Currently AuShadha is under active development and is not fit in anyway for real world use.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Structure\r\n=================\r\nAuShadha_logo : Contains the logo, with SVG and .png file along with License.\r\n\r\ndocs          : Contains the Requirements.txt, License.txt\r\n\r\nsrc           : Project Source Code, Media files(Icons,Images, File uploads), Javscript (custom and Dojo)\r\n\r\nREADME.md\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlan\r\n=====\r\n1) I plan to develop the Clinic, Patient, Physician, Nurse modules first.  \r\n2) Visit Module will be next followed by Clinical Exam, Investigations, Procedure, Discharge, Prescription  \r\n3) Stock and Pharmacy will follow.  \r\n4) Allergy and Incident Reports next  \r\n5) Admission Module will follow.   \r\n6) Specific public health modules like Paediatrics, Neonatology, Gynaecology/ Obstetrics will be last as by then\r\n   the interdependencies will be solved  \r\n\r\n\r\nWant to participate ?\r\n====================\r\n\r\nSuggestions and participation are welcome.   \r\n\r\nPlease email me at dreaswar@gmail.com  \r\nVisit me at http://www.dreaswar.com  \r\nFollow me at http://www.twitter.com/dreaswar/  \r\nFollow the Project news at http://www.facebook.com/AuShadha/  \r\n\r\n","google":"AuShadha, Open Source Public Health Electronic Medical Records in Django, Python and Dojo"}
